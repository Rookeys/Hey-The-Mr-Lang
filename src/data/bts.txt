BTS, also known as Bangtan Sonyeondan (which translates to "Bulletproof Boy Scouts"), is a globally popular South Korean boy band that formed in Seoul in 2013. The group consists of seven members: RM (Kim Namjoon), Jin (Kim Seokjin), Suga (Min Yoongi), J-Hope (Jung Hoseok), Jimin (Park Jimin), V (Kim Taehyung), and Jungkook (Jeon Jungkook). Each member has his own unique role, often categorized into vocalists, rappers, and dancers, though many of them are skilled in multiple areas.

BTS is known for their diverse range of music styles, which includes elements of hip hop, pop, R&B, and EDM. They are particularly noted for their socially conscious lyrics, which address topics like mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism.

Their rise to fame can be attributed to their active engagement with fans through social media, their impressive live performances, and their authentic and relatable persona. BTS has a massive fanbase known as "ARMY," an acronym for "Adorable Representative MC for Youth."

BTS has achieved numerous milestones and records. They have multiple chart-topping albums and singles, have performed at major international venues, and have received numerous awards both in South Korea and internationally. They have also been influential in spreading Korean culture and language worldwide, contributing to the broader phenomenon known as the Korean Wave, or "Hallyu."

Apart from their music, BTS is known for their philanthropic efforts and positive influence. They have been involved in various campaigns and have spoken at the United Nations, promoting messages of self-love and global youth empowerment.

As of my last update in April 2023, BTS continues to be a dominant force in the global music scene, though it's always best to check the most current sources for the latest developments and achievements.
